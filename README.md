The close parallel between disease incidence and mortality highlights the poor prognosis associated with pancreatic cancer \cite{siegel2014cancer}. The prevalence was 2098 in 2017 and 5-year survival in the Netherlands remains as low as 9\% in patients with pancreatic cancer \cite{nlKankerregistratie}. Worldwide the incidence ranges from 1 to 10 cases per 100,000 people for all types of pancreatic cancer, 85\% of which are adenocarcinomas \cite{ryan2014pancreatic}. The late stage at which patients are diagnosed is perhaps the most important factor underlying the low survival rate. Development of the disease is often asymptomatic until development into an advanced stage, of which 20\% is feasible for initial resection \cite{gillen2010preoperative}. Potentially curative resection often leads to recurrence \cite{siegel2014cancer}. Poor chemo- and radiotherapy response, early recurrence and metastasis is supported by the tumor biology of pancreatic cancer. Distant metastases complicate 90\% of pancreatic cancer cases according to autopsy series \cite{kamisawa1995hematogenous}. Family history of pancreatic cancer \cite{hruban2010update}, a personal history of smoking \cite{iodice2008tobacco}, chronic pancreatitis \cite{raimondi2010pancreatic} and diabetes mellitus \cite{bosetti2014diabetes,sah2013new} have been identified as risk factors for pancreatic cancer.
