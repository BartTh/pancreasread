=====

The intention of this project was to make implementation of deep learning algorithms more feasible in the general clinic. It was thus not about performance and evaluation of a certain algorithm but about creating an environment that allows for exploration of possibilities. With this in mind it was important that the application has an interchangeable algorithm, and can be changed easily for different purposes. This github presents a Flask based application where the deep learning prediction algorithm is run in linux, emphasizing application modularity. This web application has a basic uploading interface (/), a processing page (/stream) and an image review page (/view). The application is based on HTML5 and Javascript to prevent necessity of external software allowing for direct usage in the a browser controlled by the clinician. A visual overview can be seen in the figure below.
